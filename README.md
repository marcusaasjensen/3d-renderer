# üñºÔ∏è 3D Renderer in C++
A CPU-based 3D renderer written in C++, supporting simple primitive shapes and built entirely from scratch.

Upload the `.ppm` image file here to visualize the result: <href src="https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html">https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html</href>

Supports both **perspective** and **orthographic** projections.

Supports simple `.obj` imports (assets/teapot.obj).

## Rendering Pipeline Stages

- **Object Space (Local Space)**  
  Vertices are defined relative to each object's origin.  
  Example: A unit cube centered at (0,0,0).

- **World Space**  
  The object's local transform (position, rotation, scale) is applied.  
  All objects now share a common 3D world space.

- **Camera (View) Space**  
  The scene is transformed relative to the camera‚Äôs position and orientation.

- **Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC)**  
  All geometry is normalized into the range [-1, 1].

- **Screen Space**  
  NDC is mapped to 2D pixel coordinates on the canvas.

- **Rasterization**
  Z-Buffer precalculated and used for triangles rasterization.
  Vertices that are outside of the camera's view are ignored.
  Wireframe triangles are rasterized onto the canvas.
